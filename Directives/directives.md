#Angular Directives!!!

###If you haven't noticed, we have used directives in our previous two applications.

###Does ng-app, ng-controller, and ng-model sound familiar?? Hope they do because they are one of many Angular's directives.

##But,... What are directives in Angular?
  - In Google, the definition of directive is: an official or authoritative **__instruction__**.  So pretty much, directives are like markers or 
  special attributes used in your HTML for a certain behavior according to the directives.
  - Angular has pre-defined directives which has many different functionality and behavior.
  - Angular also lets you define your own custom directives as well, but we will get into that later on... But remember keep that in mind and try to 
  understand directives and custom directives on your own.
