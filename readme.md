#Intro to Angular

##What is Angular?
  - Angular is a structural javascript framework for dynamic web applications that follows the Model, View, Controller (MVC) structure.
  - Angular revolves around the MVC structure letting you use HTML as your template language for data binding, forms and validation, adding new behavior to DOM, two-way binding, and many more!
  - Angular is a powerful single page application meaning, your Angular Project will just work on a single-page of the browser.
  - For more information you can always check out angular documentation and many more.
